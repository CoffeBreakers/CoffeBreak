## The App: 
  CoffeeBreak is a user friendly and dynamic application that gets only the news YOU want to read. By summarizing articles from the best  sources to personalized topics and search results, CofeeBreak is  a true modern way to stay up to date with current events. Very easy to use, just sign up and select your favorite topics. You no longer need to look through unwanted topics and illustrations while searching for the ones that interest you.

## Built by:
  - Cesar A.
  - Robin M.
  - Sergey S.

## Idea:
  CoffeBreak was inspired by the realization that people stopped reading news and articles because they see a lot of information they do not like while processing articles from New York Times or San Francisco Chronicle. Some articles are disturbing and may ruin your day. CofeeBreak will help people to avoid seeing unwanted topics and still be up to date on current events.  Our creation is a modern news filter.
